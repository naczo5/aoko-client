# aoko client Developer Guide

Welcome to the aoko client project! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, workflow, implementation details, and version differences for anyone working on this repository, including AI agents.

## 1. Project Architecture

aoko client is a split-architecture utility client designed for Lunar Client (Minecraft).

*   **Aoko (C# / .NET 8 WPF):** 
    *   Acts as the external GUI, profile manager, and loader.
    *   Hosts the cheat logic (`Clicker.cs`), simulating inputs using Win32 `SendInput`.
    *   Connects to the native bridge over a TCP socket (`127.0.0.1:25590`) via `GameStateClient.cs`.
*   **McInjector (C++ Native Bridge DLLs):** 
    *   Injected into the Lunar Client process.
    *   `bridge.dll`: Legacy bridge for Minecraft 1.8.9.
    *   `bridge_261.dll`: Modern bridge for Minecraft 1.21.x, Lunar 26.1 and Lunar 26.2.
    *   Uses JNI to read game state data directly from the JVM.
    *   Contains native module engines: **KillAura** (pre-motion tick injection, silent aim rotation interpolation, auto-block), **Nick Hider** (JVMTI local name filtering), and **Hit Delay Fix** (attack cooldown reset).
    *   Hosts the TCP server on port `25590` to send JSON data to the C# client and receive configuration updates.
    *   Hooks OpenGL (`wglSwapBuffers` / `SwapBuffers`) for rendering in-game overlays. Both active bridges render through ImGui/OpenGL backends.
    *   **Vulkan (Lunar 26.2+):** `bridge_261.dll` also ships a real Vulkan ImGui backend (`render_backend.cpp` + `imgui/imgui_impl_vulkan.*`). It hooks the `vulkan-1.dll` loader trampolines (`vkCreateInstance`/`vkCreateDevice`/`vkCreateSwapchainKHR`/`vkQueuePresentKHR`/`vkDestroySwapchainKHR`/`vkDestroyDevice`), builds a `LOAD` render pass over the game's own swapchain images, and composites the overlay before present (chaining semaphores + rewriting `pPresentInfo`). The renderer is auto-detected at runtime: whichever present path (`wglSwapBuffers` vs `vkQueuePresentKHR`) fires first owns the session. Kill-switch: `AOKO_BRIDGE261_VULKAN=0`. Vulkan headers + the ImGui backend are vendored under `McInjector/src/main/cpp/{vulkan,imgui}/`; Vulkan entry points are loaded dynamically (no `vulkan-1.lib` link).
    *   Hooks `WndProc` to manage cursor state and block game input when the internal ClickGUI is open.

**Note on Unused Code:**
The obsolete Java agent manifests were removed. The native C++ bridges (`bridge.cpp`, `bridge_261.cpp`) perform all JNI reflections and host the TCP server on port `25590` themselves.

## 2. Working with the Project

### Prerequisites
*   Windows 10/11 x64
*   Lunar Client
*   .NET 8 SDK
*   MinGW-w64 + JDK 17 headers

### Building
Use the provided batch scripts in the root directory:
*   `build_dll.bat`: Builds both C++ bridge DLLs.
*   `build_exe.bat`: Publishes the C# loader.
*   `build_release.bat`: Full pipeline build.

### Running
Run `Aoko.exe` (or `dotnet run` in `Aoko`), select the version, and click "Inject".

For legacy 1.8.9, menu injection is supported: you can inject while in menus/lobby and mappings will bootstrap when entering a world.

## 3. How to Implement New Features

### Adding Cheat Logic (e.g., a new Aim or Click feature)
**Where:** `Aoko/Core/Clicker.cs`
1.  Add configuration properties (e.g., `MyNewCheatEnabled`).
2.  Add a new Loop method (e.g., `MyNewCheatLoop`) and manage its lifecycle via `CancellationTokenSource`, similar to `AimAssistLoop` or `TriggerbotLoop`.
3.  Prefer Win32 `SendInput` (`_leftClickInputs`, `_aimAssistMoveInput`, etc.) for input simulation when it is reliable. Do not send raw packets directly.
4.  Update the TCP config payload in `GameStateClient.cs` (`ConfigSenderLoop`) to send the toggle state to the bridge (so the in-game GUI knows about it).
5.  Update `BridgeCapabilities.cs`, `bridge_capabilities.h`, profile persistence, keybind maps, and tests when the feature is gated by bridge/version support.

### Adding Visual Overlays
**Where:** `McInjector/src/main/cpp/bridge_261.cpp` (and `bridge.cpp` for legacy)
1.  Read the incoming config state in `ParseConfig` in the bridge.
2.  Implement rendering logic inside the swap-buffer hook using ImGui draw lists. The legacy 1.8.9 bridge keeps helper names such as `DrawText2D`, but those helpers now feed ImGui foreground draw lists instead of owning a separate raw-GL font path.
3.  Use the `WorldToScreen` functions to project 3D game coordinates to 2D screen coordinates.

### Extracting New Game State
**Where:** C++ Bridges and `GameStateClient.cs`
1.  **C++ Bridge:** Use JNI to discover the target fields/methods in the `DiscoverMappings` or `TryResolveRenderMappings` routines. 
2.  **C++ Bridge:** Read the data during the render loop/background threads and append it to the JSON payload sent to the C# client.
3.  **C# Loader:** Update `GameState.cs` to include the new fields. Ensure it parses the incoming JSON correctly.

## 4. The Golden Rules: What to Do and Not to Do

*   **DO NOT** modify the game state recklessly via JNI (e.g., do not set health, do not force rotations via Java fields). 
*   **DO NOT** add raw packet spam or unrelated combat/gameplay calls from the C++ bridge. 
*   **DO** observe state first, then mutate only through scoped module logic with explicit validation, version gating, and failure logging.
*   **DO** use `SendInput` from the external C# loader to simulate human input when that path is reliable.
*   **DO** keep JNI writes and gameplay interactions narrow, intentional, and feature-owned (e.g., reach via entity attributes, velocity scaling, nametag visibility suppression, or other module-specific interactions that cannot be implemented reliably through OS input).
*   **DO** respect the cross-thread limitations of JNI. Only use JNI calls from threads properly attached to the JVM. Avoid heavy JNI reflection inside the high-frequency `wglSwapBuffers` render thread; cache method and field IDs beforehand!
*   **DO** preserve **menu-injection compatibility** in all code changes (especially 1.8.9): mappings and feature behavior must recover correctly when injected in menus/lobby, not only when injected in-world.
*   **DO** prefer a single deterministic path when runtime evidence shows fallback branches are unnecessary. Keep fallback/recovery logic only where logs prove it is needed.

## 5. Version Differences & Mappings

The codebase is split strictly into two runtime paradigms due to massive differences in the Minecraft codebase between 1.8.9 and modern versions (1.21.x).

### Legacy Bridge (`bridge.cpp` - Minecraft 1.8.9)
*   **Mappings:** Minecraft 1.8.9 is heavily obfuscated without official deobfuscation maps. 
*   **Discovery:** The bridge uses deep reflection and heuristic scanning. For example, it finds the `thePlayer` field by scanning for a singleton object, checking its methods for one returning a `float` named `getHealth`, and verifying field types.
*   **World Structure:** Entities and TileEntities (chests) are stored in flat lists (`playerEntities`, `loadedTileEntityList`) on the `WorldClient` object.
*   **Camera:** Matrix data is retrieved from `ActiveRenderInfo` (`MODELVIEW` and `PROJECTION` FloatBuffers). Viewer position is taken from `RenderManager`.
*   **Rendering:** The 1.8.9 bridge links the same vendored ImGui, OpenGL loader, and MinHook sources as the modern bridge. ImGui initialization is split across clean swap frames and preserves GL state to avoid destabilizing Lunar rendering.
*   **State:** The legacy state payload now includes `pitch`.

### Modern Bridge (`bridge_261.cpp` - Minecraft 1.21 / Lunar 26.1)
*   **The 1.21 vs 26.1 Mapping Shift:** There is a profound difference in how Minecraft 1.21 and Minecraft 26.1 are structured, which is why `bridge_261.cpp` relies on a fallback array mechanism:
    *   **Minecraft 1.21 (Obfuscated Era):** The game is obfuscated. Lunar 1.21 runs on Fabric, meaning the bridge must target **Yarn Intermediary mappings** (e.g., `net.minecraft.class_1657`, `method_18798`).
    *   **Minecraft 26.1 (Unobfuscated Era):** Starting with 26.1, Mojang officially stopped obfuscating Minecraft. Mappings like Yarn are deprecated. The game natively uses **Official Mojang Mappings** (e.g., `net.minecraft.world.entity.player.Player`, `getDeltaMovement`). [Read more on the transition to unobfuscated Minecraft](https://fabricmc.net/).
    
    To support *both* seamlessly, the bridge checks the Yarn (`class_`) name first for 1.21 compatibility, and falls back to the Official/Mojmap name for 26.1.
    
    *Code Example of Class Lookup in `bridge_261.cpp`:*
    ```cpp
    // The bridge tries Yarn (1.21) first, then Official/Mojmap (26.1)
    const char* names[] = {
        "net.minecraft.class_239",                     // 1.21 Yarn
        "net.minecraft.world.phys.HitResult",          // 26.1 Official / 1.21 Mojmap
        nullptr
    };
    ```
    
    *Exact Mapping Differences (1.21 vs 26.1):*
    *   **PlayerEntity:** 1.21 uses `net.minecraft.class_1657` | 26.1 uses `net.minecraft.world.entity.player.Player`
    *   **HitResult:** 1.21 uses `net.minecraft.class_239` | 26.1 uses `net.minecraft.world.phys.HitResult`
    *   **BlockState:** 1.21 uses `net.minecraft.class_2680` | 26.1 uses `net.minecraft.world.level.block.state.BlockState`
    *   **Identifier / ResourceLocation:** 1.21 uses `net.minecraft.class_2960` | 26.1 uses `net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation`
    *   **getVelocity Method:** 1.21 uses `method_18798` | 26.1 uses `getDeltaMovement` (or `getVelocity`)

*   **World Structure:** Block Entities (like Chests) are no longer in a flat list. They are chunk-based. The bridge must query `WorldChunk.blockEntities` (1.21 Yarn `field_12833`) Map to find them.
*   **Camera:** `ActiveRenderInfo` is gone. Matrices are retrieved via `GameRenderer` (1.21 `class_757`) and `Camera` (1.21 `class_4184`) classes, grabbing JOML `Matrix4f` objects.
*   **HitResults:** The `HitResult` system is different. Looking at air still returns a `BlockHitResult`, but with a `Type` of `MISS`. Reach and Triggerbot logic in C# accounts for this.

## 6. Module Implementations & Design Differences

Because the rendering and state extraction differ heavily, the design of visual modules and state modifications is distinct between versions.

### External Modules (Shared Logic)
*   **Aim Assist & Triggerbot:** These are handled almost entirely in the external C# application (`Aoko/Core/Clicker.cs`). They rely on the game state (player position, rotations, entity lists) streamed over TCP. 
    *   **Aim Assist** calculates pitch/yaw differences and simulates mouse movement using Win32 `SendInput`.
    *   **Triggerbot** tracks server attack cooldowns and crosshair state, simulating clicks via `SendInput`.

### Visual Modules (Nametags, Chest ESP, ClickGUI)
*   **Modern Design (1.21.x / 26.1):** Heavily utilizes **ImGui**. The ClickGUI uses standard ImGui windows. Overlays use `ImGui::GetBackgroundDrawList()` to draw text/rectangles. Entity and chunk iterations are used for Nametags and Chest ESP with JOML matrices for projection.
*   **Legacy Design (1.8.9):** Also uses ImGui now. The bridge still exposes legacy drawing helpers for module code, but text/rectangles are emitted through ImGui foreground draw lists and the build includes `imgui_impl_win32`, `imgui_impl_opengl3`, `gl_loader.cpp`, and MinHook.
*   **Nametags Option:** Nametags include a hide-vanilla toggle that attempts native nametag visibility suppression (no visual mask fallback). The modern bridge now supports Mojmap/Yarn scoreboard variants, retries mapping resolution when startup mapping is incomplete, and exposes **Reload Mappings** as a full JNI remap across modules (not nametag-only). If required mappings are unsupported on a runtime/build, it fails open and logs exactly what is missing.

### Internal Game State Modules (Reach & Velocity)
These modules modify the game state and execute within the C++ bridges, presenting the biggest architectural splits:
*   **Reach:**
    *   *Modern (1.21):* Exploits the `ENTITY_INTERACTION_RANGE` entity attribute introduced in newer Minecraft versions. The bridge fetches the player's attribute instance and dynamically invokes `setBaseValue()` to increase reach.
    *   *Legacy (1.8.9):* Performs a manual math-based raycast. When the user clicks, if an entity is within the extended reach range, the bridge overwrites the game's `objectMouseOver` field (and `pointedEntity`) with the target.
*   **Velocity:**
    *   *Modern (1.21):* Tracks the player's `hurtTime` to detect knockback. When hit, it fetches the player's `Vec3` velocity via `getVelocity()`, scales the X/Y/Z components based on the config, and applies it using `setVelocity()` (`setDeltaMovement`).
    *   *Legacy (1.8.9):* Directly scales the primitive `motionX`, `motionY`, and `motionZ` fields on the `EntityPlayer` object when `hurtTime` spikes.

## 7. Logs and Debugging

When working with JNI and class mappings, failures are common.
*   The C++ bridges output extensive debug information next to the injected DLL: `bridge_debug.log` for 1.8.9 and `bridge_261_debug.log` for 1.21.x / 26.1.
*   Always check the matching bridge log to see mapping reports and feature-specific unresolved JNI messages. It will explicitly list which fields, methods, or runtime caches failed to resolve.
*   C# logging is routed to `Debug.WriteLine` and can be viewed in Visual Studio's output window or via a standard debugger attached to the loader process.
